# ai_BANKBOOKZ

ai_BANKBOOKZ is a personal financial app to track stock trades. First as a_digital_ledger, then, enhanced to generate metadata, for analytics and data visualization. 

Think of it, navigating all the math in financial markets. Daunting and audacious, and also not impossible with emergent technology. So this is an AI integration STUDY of CONCEPTS, for Artificial Intelligence and Finance in Vanilla JavaScript. Because, Vanilla is my favorite, and for an easier and faster - workflow. Of which, most people do not yet know.

This software was made for personal use, by an advanced computer scientist, for educational purposes, and released here, under MIT. Author is not responsible for use or results. There is no warranty or guarantee. Author does not want credit, you are free to use for commercial profit, without . This software is not intended to be perfect, it is used to learn, HOW TO mix financial software with Artificial Intelligence.

Practicing writing many PRECISE MATHMATIC ALGORITHMS, with patterns and practices of ENCODERS and DECODERS, TRANSFORMERS, including concepts like sentiment analysis with natural language processing, and large language model, if applicable. 

The first GOAL, was for a LEDGER. Then it became an ai_LEDGER.
Then it expanded from MARGINS to STORY, visualizations then TAX_ESTIMATE.
A Colorful FIFO GRID was created. And a QUICK ENTRY UI.

Next is CHARTS.
Also an ESTIMATE module is hidden in background.
There are 4 more EDIT_GRIDS that can be added.

It is really fun and educational code to write.
